# SICSS-Oxford-2022

This is a lecture on "Online Survey and Post-Stratification" for SICSS-Oxford 2022. It is inspired from previous lectures prepared with Dr. Emanuele Del Fava. 

## Online Surveys

We start with examples from using Facebook as a way to recruit survey respondents. We stress the importance of using quota sampling.  


## Post-Stratification

### Exercise

Six outcomes:

- 1. No. total contacts (count variable): cnt_count_30
- 2. No. contacts at work (count variable): cnt_count_w_30
- 3. No. contacts in the general community (count variable): cnt_count_gc_30
- 4. Wearing a face mask (dummy variable): worn_face_mask
- 5. Threat to the world, to the country or to the local community (0-1 variable): threat_community_q
- 6. Threat to oneself or to the family (0-1 variable): threat_personal_q
